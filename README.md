# Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression (From Scratch)

This project implements Logistic Regression from scratch using NumPy to predict whether a tumor is **Benign (0)** or **Malignant (1)**.

The goal of this project was to understand the mathematics behind Logistic Regression instead of directly using machine learning libraries.
